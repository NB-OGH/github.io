# Nima — GitHub Pages site (Polished MVP)
This repo contains a polished two-page static site for **nimaoghanian.com**.

## Files
- `index.html` — Landing page with hero, about, services, featured project, contact.
- `case-study.html` — Full case study (linked from hero + projects).
- `styles.css` — Clean, responsive styling with deep blue + teal accents.
- `assets/hero.svg`, `assets/avatar.svg` — Lightweight inline visuals.

## Deploy
1. Upload these files to your `<username>.github.io` repo root.
2. If you already configured **Settings → Pages** with `main` and `/ (root)`, it will redeploy automatically.
3. Visit `https://<username>.github.io` to verify.

## Notes
- Change colors in `:root` in `styles.css`.
- Add more pages by copying `case-study.html` and linking from `index.html`.
- For a custom domain, include a `CNAME` file with `nimaoghanian.com` and set the domain in **Settings → Pages**.
